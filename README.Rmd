## Introduction

The `mFD` package provides a **"user friendly" interface** to compute a 
**global assessment of functional diversity** by gathering computation of alpha 
and beta functional indices. As no package before, it guides users through 
functional analysis with one function per action to complete, several arguments 
that can be changed and allows personalized graphical outputs. Various tutorials 
are available on the mFD website to guide the user through the functional 
workflow.


## Installation

The `mFD` package can be installed through CRAN as follow:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Coming soon
```

or for the latest development version, the `mFD` Github repository can be used:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("CmlMagneville/mFD")
library(mFD)
```


## How to use the `mFD` package?

To compute functional diversity indices, the user needs:

- a data frame summarizing species traits (species in rows, traits in columns). 
The `mFD` package works with all kind of traits: quantitative, ordinal, nominal, 
circular and fuzzy-coded.

- a matrix summarizing species gathering into assemblages (assemblages in rows, 
species in columns). All assemblages must at least contain one species.

- a data frame summarizing traits category (first column with traits name, 
second column with traits type, third column with fuzzy name of fuzzy traits - 
if no fuzzy traits: NA).

For a complete understanding of the functional workflow and the packages 
possibilities, please refer to the 
[mFD: General workflow](https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/articles/mFD_general_workflow.html).


## Citation

To cite package `mFD` in publications use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citation("mFD")
```


## Contributions

SV, NL, CA, FL and CM coded the functions and their help.
SV and CM led tutorial writings. All authors tested the functions
and contributed to writing of helps and tutorials.
NC optimized the package and made it ready for CRAN submission.
