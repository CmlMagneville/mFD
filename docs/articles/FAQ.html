<p>We have compiled the most frequently asked questions we have received
since the launch of the package in 2021, about its use and the
multidimensional space approach for computing functional diversity
indices.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or encounter issues while using the
<code>mFD</code> package <strong>after</strong> reading this FAQ and the
tutorials on our <a href="https://cmlmagneville.github.io/%60mFD%60/index.html" class="external-link">website</a>,

<p><strong>Disclaimer/Reminder:</strong> While designing the package we
did our best to code internal checks about key inputs and write detailed
warning or error messages which appear in red color in the R console.

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-nominal-and-ordinal-traits">What is the difference between nominal and ordinal traits?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-nominal-and-ordinal-traits"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Nominal traits are used to describe features that could be
biologically categorized</strong>, such as growth form in plants or diet
for animals. Hence, nominal coding implies all categories are equally
distinct from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ordinal traits are coded using discrete values like nominal
traits, but the categories have a meaningful ranking</strong>, either
because the trait is intrinsically continuous (e.g. body size being
categorized into small, medium, large bins), or because it is
ecologically relevant to consider ordered categories. For example, if
the period of activity of animals is coded as “diurnal”, “nocturnal” or
“both”, it is relevant to consider that generalist species “both” are
functionally intermediate between the two specialists “diurnal” and
“nocturnal”.</p>
<p>This distinction is important for calculating functional distances
using the Gower metric (e.g., with the <code>mFD</code>::funct.dist()
function). In fact, using nominal traits species with different trait
values will have the same distance between each other, while using
ordinal traits, species pairs with neighboring categories (e.g., “small”
and “medium” size) will have lower distances than species pairs with
distant categories (e.g., “small” and “large”). Ordinal traits are thus
treated more similarly to continuous traits than nominal ones.</p>
<p><strong>Trait coding could vary across case studies</strong>
depending on the categories considered. For example, if diet is coded
using categories describing main preys (e.g. leaves, seeds, fruits,
invertebrates, vertebrates) nominal coding is the most relevant, while
if diet is coded using broader categories actually reflecting trophic
levels (e.g. plants, plants &amp; animals, animals) it could be
considered as an ordinal trait. Note that if there are only two
categories, coding the trait as ordinal or ordinal has no impact.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code> function, uses the gawdis()
function (from the gawdis package)(<a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/gawdis/man/gawdis.html" class="external-link uri">https://rdrr.io/cran/gawdis/man/gawdis.html</a>) which
handles ordinal traits with various methods. Using the
<code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code> function, you are able to choose among
three methods commonly used, which can be: <code>classic</code> which
treats ordinal variables as continuous variables, <code>metric</code>
which refers to Eq. 3 of Podani (1999), <code>podani</code> which refers
to Eqs. 2a-b of Podani (1999). The last two options convert ordinal
variables to ranks. The <code>mFD::funct_dist()</code> default is
<code>classic</code> for which the final distance between two species
doesn’t depend on the traits values of the other species (as it is the
case for the two other options).</p>

</h3>
<p>If two traits are highly correlated (&gt; 0.8), we advise removing
one of the two traits to not overweight this facet. We suggest removing
the trait which is more correlated to the other traits or the one which
ecologically makes least sense, if any. If traits are moderately
correlated (0.6 &lt; r &lt; 0.8), using a PCA-based functional space
will ensure functional axes are not correlated to each other.</p>

</h3>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>I collected species traits in
my studied sites, how can I incorporate these traits data measured at
the site level into the <code>mFD</code> framework?</strong></span></p>
<p>To be able to eventually compare values of FD indices between
assemblages, it is compulsory to have all the FD indices computed in the
same functional space built on all species present in all your sites
(just like when assessing phylogenetic diversity on a single tree
linking all species).</p>
<p>Hence, when a study aims to account for intraspecific variability,
you could consider your combinations of species_site as the “functional”
units for FD computation. So you will have a
<code>species_site*traits</code> matrix instead of the
<code>species*traits</code> in our tutorial example, and similarly a
<code>sites*species_site</code> matrix with abundance. In these
matrices, trait values and abundances should be averaged across
replicates for each site.</p>

</h3>
<p>If you were not able to measure/get trait values for all the studied
species and hence have a <code>species*traits</code> dataframe
containing NA, some functions of <code>mFD</code> will return an error
message. Indeed, <strong>while having NA values does not prevent from
computing Gower distance, such missing values often yield patterns of
species pairwise distance.</strong> In fact, distance between species is
computed using only traits which have values for both species within a
pair, hence two species could have a distance of 0 if they have the same
trait values for traits without NA, while having different distances to
a third species depending on values of traits with shared NA. So we
suggest imputing missing trait values using the most relevant methods
depending on the study case (cf <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13185" class="external-link uri">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13185</a>).</p>
<p>If you decide to continue the functional analysis with NA, you will
have to set the argument stop_if_NA to FALSE otherwise the process will
stop.</p>

</h3>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>I am computing the Gower
distance between species, as my data includes quantitative, categorical,
and fuzzy traits. However, applying PCoA with Gower distances can lead
to negative eigenvalues, and the <code>mFD</code> package does not
support corrections like Lingoes or Cailliez. What should I do?
</strong></span></p>
<p>As ecologists, we know that collecting trait values for all our
studied species is time consuming so eventually we want to be sure that
<strong>the FD indices are computed in a space that faithfully
represents those traits values</strong>, hence the Gower distance
computed on them.</p>
<p>Faithfulness is measured with deviation metrics such as mAD or rmSD
which compare raw distances based on traits values and distances in the
functional space. Based on simulations, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12299" class="external-link">Maire
et al (2015)</a> demonstrated that there is always a faithful space
(with a low mAD) without applying a correction (note that the first PC
axes kept to build such faithful spaces have always positive
eigenvalues).</p>
<p>Even if square root transformation of distance before PCoA prevents
negative eigenvalues, it actually <strong>alters the actual distances
between species that are based on trait values you took a lot of care
(and effort/time) to accurately measure/retrieve</strong> .Similarly,
Cailliez correction also modifies distances by adding a constant to all
values, affecting the relative differences between them. Therefore,
since our goal is to ensure that FD indices are computed in a space that
faithfully represents the raw trait values, we do not recommend applying
any corrections.</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>Is there an inbuilt function
to overlay traits as vectors in the PCoA representing the
multidimensional functional space using
<code><a href="../reference/funct.space.plot.html">mFD::funct.space.plot()</a></code> instead of the boxplot produced by
<code>mFD::trait.faxes.corr()</code>?</strong></span></p>
<p>No, adding vectors to the PCoA space to show how traits relate to
axes is not possible in the <code>mFD</code> package. This approach is
typically used with PCA, but PCoA differs from PCA, making it complex to
compute and represent actual vector lengths. To check the correlation
between axes and traits in the <code>mFD</code> package, we recommend
using the <code>mFD::trait.faxes.corr()</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="cumulative-variance-explained-by-pcoa-axes">Cumulative variance explained by PCoA axes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cumulative-variance-explained-by-pcoa-axes"></a>
</h3>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>How can I check the cumulative
variance explained by the PCoA axes in the functional space? Where can I
access the variance explained by each PCoA axis? (as usually done with a
PCA)</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of PCA is to find axes which reflect as best as possible
traits variability. Relying on a matrix of correlation between traits,
it is looking for axes which best reflect traits variability, and thus
reduces the traits number to a lower number of variables, called
principal components.</p>
<p>Unlike PCA, the goal of PCoA is to optimize distances between samples
- here species. Relying on a distance matrix (here, distances between
species based on their traits), it optimizes the representation of these
distances, to visualize them in a low-dimensional space, without too
much loss of information. As in a PCA, the first axis explains as much
of the variation as possible, the second axis explains as much of the
remaining variation as possible etc. However, while decomposing
distances in principal components, some eigenvalues can have negative
values - they represent possible mathematical axes which are difficult
to envision. As explained earlier (FAQ - Part “Functional traits”),
<code>mFD</code> doesn’t include an option to correct for these negative
eigenvalues as these options alter trait-based distances, thus the total
variation explained by PCoA axes might not faithfully represent the
total variation captured by all axes.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend using the “mad” metric to assess the quality
of the functional space, as this metric shows how much trait-based
distances are faithfully represented in the multidimensional space.</p>

</h3>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>The output of the
<code><a href="../reference/quality.fspaces.html">mFD::quality.fspaces()</a></code> function indicates that the best
functional space uses 5 axes. However, some of my assemblages have 5
species or fewer, and using the 5D space would require me to exclude
these small assemblages. What should I do?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Choosing a functional space is always a trade-off between its
quality and being able to compute functional indices on most of the
assemblages given the number of species they have</strong>. Some
indices, like FRic and FDiv, can only be computed if the number of
species is greater than the number of functional axes. If you want to
compute these indices, the best quality functional space might not be
your best option. For example, if the 5D space has the highest quality
but some of your assemblages have 5 species or fewer, consider the
quality of the 4D space and use it, if it still maintains good quality.
While making this trade-off, remember that 2D spaces generally have poor
quality (cf. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12299" class="external-link">Maire

</h3>
<p>Functional Entities (FEs) are groups of species sharing the same
traits combination, in other words, the functional distance between
species pairs belonging to a given FE is zero.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code> function returns a warning when at
least one species pair has a functional distance which equals zero
(“Functional distance between some species is equal to 0. You can choose
to gather species into Functional Entities gathering species with
similar traits values”). But whether or not you will work with FEs
depends on how many species pairs have a functional distance equaling 0.
If it doesn’t concern a lot of your species pairs, you can continue
working with species, whereas if a substantial number of the species
pairs have a functional distance equaling 0, you might want to work with
FEs.</p>
<p>If you decide not to work with FEs but some of your species pairs
have a functional distance equaling 0, keep in mind that you might
encounter errors while computing functional indices, depending on the
distribution of species within your assemblages. In fact, as species
belonging to the same FE have the same position in the functional space,
it could lead to problems while computing functional indices, for
instance not being able to compute the convex-hull of Functional
Richness if species delineating the assemblage have the same position in
the functional space.</p>

</h3>
<p>When using Functional Entities (FEs), you can compute functional
indices based on those described by Mouillot et al. (2014) (see our <a href="https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/articles/How_to_deal_with_Functional_Entities.html">tutorial</a>,
as well as alpha and beta metrics from <a href="https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/articles/mFD_general_workflow.html">our
general workflow tutorial</a>, including FRic, FDiv, FDis, FEve, FSpe,
FMPD, FNND, FIde, and FORi.</p>
<p>To work with Functional Entities, you need data frames similar to
those used for species but with FEs information. Specifically, you
need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A FEs × assemblages matrix (assemblages in rows and FEs in
columns)</li>
<li>A traits × FEs matrix (FEs in rows and traits in columns)</li>
</ul>
<p>To compute indices based on Functional Entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code><a href="../reference/sp.to.fe.html">mFD::sp.to.fe()</a></code> to group species into FEs and
create the traits × FEs dataframe.</li>
<li>Build the assemblage × FEs dataframe using fe_nm, which lists which
species belong to each FE, and the species × assemblages dataframe.</li>
<li>Compute functional distances between FEs with
<code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code>.</li>
<li>Follow the general workflow tutorial with the matrix of functional
distances between FEs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have added new functions in the development version of the
<code>mFD</code> package to assist with these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="../reference/from.spfe.to.feasb.html">mFD::from.spfe.to.feasb()</a></code>: Computes the assemblages ×

assemblage, use the output: <code>details$asb_dist_nn_asb</code> (which
is computed only if you are computing the FNND index)</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>My dataset includes 2 fuzzy
traits and 2 non-fuzzy traits. In the provided tutorials, fuzzy traits
are only used when calculating diversity indices based on Hill Numbers
or Beta Diversity. Is this because the authors omitted fuzzy traits from
the alpha diversity tutorial for simplicity, or is it not advisable to
use fuzzy traits for calculating alpha diversity
indices?</strong></span></p>
<p>We omitted fuzzy traits in the general workflow showing how to
compute alpha and beta indices in a multidimensional space to keep the
example simple. The workflow does work with fuzzy traits.</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>I’m using fuzzy traits and
giving a weight for each modality. While computing the distance matrix
with the <code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code> function, a warning suggests
omitting columns related to fuzzy traits due to uneven distribution.
Since these traits are proportional values from 0 to 1 and sum to 1 with
other columns for the same fuzzy trait, is it safe to ignore this
warning?</strong></span></p>
<p>It’s a warning message from the gawdis() function of the gawdis
package. The warning is made based on a check for each trait modality,
you can check the code <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/gawdis/src/R/gawdis.R#google_vignette" class="external-link">here</a>
(last lines for the warning message). For more information you can read
the gawdis package description and the <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13537" class="external-link">paper
from De Bello</a>. The <code>mFD</code> package, does not (yet) include
this corrected-weight approach but if you want to use it, you can use
the gawdis::gawdis() function instead of <code><a href="../reference/funct.dist.html">mFD::funct.dist()</a></code>
and use its outputs in other <code>mFD</code> functions.</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>How can I explain a high beta
diversity between assemblages in the multidimensional space and low
functional beta diversity using the generalization of Hill
numbers?</strong></span></p>
<p>The beta-diversity indices based on overlap of convex hulls (computed
through <code>mFD::beta.fd.multidim())</code> and those based on
distance between species (computed through
<code><a href="../reference/beta.fd.hill.html">mFD::beta.fd.hill()</a></code>) are measuring different types of
dissimilarity. Convex hulls account for the species with the most
extreme coordinates, while Hill index accounts for position (and biomass
if available) of all species. Hence they provide complementary
indicators of how assemblages differ to each other.</p>

<p>Gamma=alpha*beta decompositions are presented for the general case of
N communities in Chao et al (2019). In the <code>mFD</code> package, we
have coded the most common use for ecologists, which is N=2. Thus, the
beta function calculates values for all possible pairs among the N.
Gamma and alpha values are returned if store.details=TRUE is set.</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><strong>While reading the “Compute
Functional Diversity Hill Indices”, I am struggling to understand the
phrase “functionally equally distinct species”. What does it
mean?</strong></span></p>
<p>The “functionally equally distinct species” refers to the concept of
Hill numbers (see Jost (2006) Ecology) that refers “to the number of
equivalent species”. The main point is that the higher the index, the
higher the proportion of biomass on the most distant species. If FDq
equals 1, it means that all species are functionally identical so it is
like having a single “functional” unit.</p>

<code><a href="../reference/beta.fd.hill.html">mFD::beta.fd.hill()</a></code> function with presence-absence data and
setting q = 0. However, the output only contains null values
(beta_fd_q$q0 = 0). Why is this happening?</strong></span></p>
<p>In Chao’s framework, the parameter tau is used to indicate that all
species with a distance &lt; tau are considered to be in the same
functional unit (equivalent to species in taxonomy). You get 0 in your
case, as even though the species have different trait values, they are
similar to each other. If you want more sensitivity for q=0, you can set
tau=min.</p>

<p>There is currently no option in the

However, you can use the functions within
<code><a href="../reference/alpha.multidim.plot.html">mFD::alpha.multidim.plot()</a></code> to achieve this by creating a
“false” assemblage that includes species from both assemblages you want
to plot. In the <a href="https://cmlmagneville.github.io/mFD/articles/Customised_plots.html">following
tutorial we have shown how to use these functions</a>.</p>
